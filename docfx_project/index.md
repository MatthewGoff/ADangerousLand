# ADL Documentation

## Welcome

This website is dedicated to helping you understand and manipulate the codebase. There are two sections, Articles and API Documentation, which are always available at the top menu bar. The articles provide conceptual documentation and the API Documentation is a standard API reference compiled from the XML comments.

## Directive

I implore you to prompt me to add and improve documentation wherever you need clarification, however trivial. For the most part I will be generating documentation ***as needed***.

## Contributing Documentation

The most important contribution you can make is to maintain good XML comments. If you want to contribute to the articles [here's an article detailing how](xref:AddingArticles). Note that changes you make either to the XML comments or to the articles won't appear on the website until you've built the website locally and pushed your changes. [Here's an article on using DocFX](xref:UsingDocFX). Stictly speaking you don't have to do this yourself, you can just push your changes and wait for the someone else to build the website.
