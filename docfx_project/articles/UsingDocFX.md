# Using DocFX

The repository has a docfx_project folder in it. This holds all of the sorce material needed to generate the website. Once built the website lives in the docs/ folder so that it can be found by __github pages__. In order to build the website follow [these steps](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/walkthrough/walkthrough_create_a_docfx_project.html) (Ignore step 2, that's already done). You can view the changes locally with the instructions in step 4 and once you're satisfied simply push to the remote repo to update the website. IMPORTANT: browsers frequenty cache websites and hence don't show changes. You may have to clear your recent browsing data to see the updated website.
