* **Serialization**<a name="Serialization"></a>: Serialization refers to preparing an object to be saved to a file on the computer. This allows data in the program to be saved and used again at a different runtime. There are many ways to serialize an object resulting in different representations of the object in memory. We are currently using [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/index.html).
